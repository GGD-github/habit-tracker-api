## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java 11 or higher
- Docker
- PostgreSQL
- Gradle

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GGD-github/habit-tracker-api.git
   cd habit-tracker-api
   ```

2. Configure your PostgreSQL database. Create a database named `habit_tracker`.

3. Update the `application.properties` file in `src/main/resources` with your database credentials.

### Running the Application

You can run the application using Docker or directly with Gradle.

#### Using Docker

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t habit-tracker-api .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 habit-tracker-api
   ```

#### Using Gradle

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Documentation

The API is documented using Swagger. You can access the documentation by navigating to `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html` after starting the application.

## Usage

### Authentication

To authenticate, send a POST request to `/api/auth/login` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "username": "your_username",
  "password": "your_password"
}
```

On successful login, you will receive a JWT token. Use this token for subsequent requests.

### Creating a Habit

To create a new habit, send a POST request to `/api/habits` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
  "name": "Exercise",
  "frequency": "Daily"
}
```

### Checking In

To check in for a habit, send a POST request to `/api/habits/{id}/checkin`.

### Calculating Streaks

To get streak information, send a GET request to `/api/habits/{id}/streak`.
